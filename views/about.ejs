    <p>Chihiro Hasegawa</p>
    <p>
      My home town is Yokohama (next to Tokyo), Japan. <br>
      I moved to Canada in 2021 and now live in Scarborough. <br>
      I have experiences as a software tester and a software engineer. <br>
      What I wish to do is to make my portfolio on Github better. <br>
      I am very passionate to stady in college and eager to have experiences as a full-stack developer here in Canada.
      <br>
      Love to make new connections with IT people!
